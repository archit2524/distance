            <h3><strong>Exceptions Handling</strong> </h3>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">

                • An exception (or exceptional event) is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.</br>
                • When an Exception occurs the normal flow of the program is disrupted and thenprogram/Appiication terminates abnormally,therefore these exceptions are needs to be handled.</br>
                • A Java Exception is an object that describes the exception that occurs in a program. When annexceptional event occurs in java, an exception is said to be thrown.</br>
                • An exception can occur for many different reasons, some of them are as given below:</br>
                • A user has entered invalid data.</br>
                • A file that needs to be opened cannot be found.</br>
                • A network connection has been lost in the middle of communications, or the JVM has run out of memory.</br>
                • Exceptions are caused by users, programmers or when some physical resources get failed.</br>
                • The Exception Handling in java is one of the powerful mechanisms to handle the exceptionn(runtime errors), so that normal flow of the application can be maintained.</br></br>
                • In Java there are three categories of Exceptions:</br>
                </br>
                1) Checked exceptions: A checked exception is an exception that occurs at the compile time,
                these are also called as compile time exceptions. Example, lOException, SQLException etc.</br>
                </br>
                2) Runtime exceptions: An Unchecked exception is an exception that occurs during the execution, these are also called as Runtime Exceptions. These include programming bugs, such as logic errors or improper use of an API.</br>
                Runtime exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation.</br>
                Example :</br>
                ArithmeticExceptlon, NullPointerException, Array Index out of Bound exception.</br>
                </br>
                3) Errors: These are not exceptions at all, but problems that arise beyond the control of the user or the programmer.</br>
                Example:</br>
                OutOfMemoryError, VirtuaiMachineErrorException.</br>
                • All exception classes are subtypes of the java.Iang.Exception class. The exception class is a subclass of the Throwable class. Other than the exception class there is another subclass called
                Error which is derived from the Throwable class.</br>
                • Errors are not normally trapped form the Java programs. These conditions normally happen in case of severe failures, which are not handled by the java programs. Errors are generated to indicate errors generated by the runtime environment. </br>
                Example: </br>
                JVM is out of Memory. Normally programs cannot recover from errors.</br>
                • The Exception class has two main subclasses: lOException class and RuntimeException class.</br>

            <h3><strong>Exception Handling Mechanism</strong> </h3>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">

                • Exception handling is done using five keywords:</br></br>
                1) try</br>
                2) catch</br>
                3) finally</br>
                4) throw</br>
                5) throws</br>
                </br>
                <strong>1) try block :</strong></br>

                • Java try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. It must be used within the method.</br>
                • Java try block must be followed by either catch or finally block.</br>
                </br>
                <strong>2) catch block :</strong></br>
                • Java catch block is used to handle the Exception. It must be used after the try block only.</br>
                • The catch block that follows the try is checked, if the type of exception that occurred is listed in the catch block then the exception is handed over to the catch block that handles it.</br>
                • You can use multiple catch block with a single try.</br>
                </br>
                Syntax:</br>
                try</br>
                {</br>
                //Protected code</br>
                }</br>
                catch(ExceptionNamel el)</br>
                {</br>
                //Catch block 1</br>
                }</br>
                catch(ExceptionName2 e2)</br>
                {</br>
                //Catch block 2</br>
                }</br></br>
                • In above syntax, there are two catch blocks. In try block, we write code that might generate exception. If the exception generated by protected code then exception thrown to the first catch block.</br>
                • If the data type of the exception thrown matches ExceptionNamel, it gets caught there and execute the catch block.</br>
                • If not, the exception passes down to the second catch block.</br>
                • This continues until the exception either is caught or falls through all catches, in that case the current method stops execution.</br>

                </br>

                <strong>Nested Try-Catch Blocks</strong></br>

                • In java, the try block within a try block is known as nested try block.</br>
                • Nested try block is used when a part of a block may cause one error while entire block may
                cause another error.</br>
                • In that case, if inner try block does not have a catch handler for a particular exception then the
                outer try is checked for match.</br>
                • This continues until one of the catch statements succeeds, or until the entire nested try
                statements are done in. If no one catch statements match
                ,then the Java run-time system will
                handle the exception.</br>
                </br>
                Syntax:</br>
                try</br>
                {</br>
                Statement 1;</br>
                try</br>
                {</br>
                //Protected code</br>
                }</br>
                catch(ExceptionName el)</br>
                {</br>
                //Catch blockl</br>
                }</br>
                }</br>
                catch(ExceptionName e2)</br>
                {</br>
                //Catch block 2</br>
                }</br>
                </br>
                Key points to keep in mind:</br>
                • A catch clause cannot exist without a try statement.</br>
                • It is not compulsory to have finally clause for every try/catch.</br>
                • The try block cannot be present without either catch clause or finally clause.</br>
                • Any code cannot be present in between the try, catch, finally block.</br>
                </br>

                <strong>4) throw :</strong></br>
                • The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.</br>
                • We can throw either checked or uncheked exception using throw keyword.</br>
                • Only object of Throwable class or its sub classes can be thrown.</br>
                • Program execution stops on encountering throw statement, and the closest catch statement is
                checked for matching type of exception.</br>
                </br>
                Syntax:</br>
                throw Throwablelnstance;</br>
                </br>

                <strong>5) throws:</strong></br>
                • The throws keyword is used to declare an exception.</br>
                • if a method does not handle a checked exception, the method must declare it using the
                throws keyword. The throws keyword appears at the end of a method's signature.</br>
                • You can declare multiple exceptions.</br>
                </br>
                Syntax:</br>
                return_type method_name(} throws exception_class_name_list</br>
                {</br>
                //method code</br>
                }</br>
            </h5>

            <h3><strong>User Defined Exception</strong> </h3>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">

                • In java, we can create our own exception that is known as custom exception or user-defined exception.</br>
                • We can have our own exception and message.</br>
                Key points to keep in mind:</br>
                • All exceptions must be a child of Throwable.</br>
                • If you want to write a checked exception that is automatically enforced by the Declare Rule, you need to extend the Exception class.</br>
                • If you want to write a runtime exception, you need to extend the RuntimeException class.</br></br>

            </h5>

            <h3><strong>Multithreading</strong> </h3>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">

                • Java is a multithreaded programming language which means we can develop multi threaded program using Java.</br>
                • Multithreaded programs contain two or more threads that can run concurrently. This means that a single program can perform two or more tasks simultaneously.</br>
                • Thread is basically a lightweight sub-process, a smallest unit of processing.</br>
                • Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.</br>
                • But we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads share a common memory area.
                • They don't allocate separate memory area which saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time than process.</br>
                • Threads are independent. So, it doesn't affect other threads if exception occurs in a single thread.</br>
                • Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation etc.</br>
                • For example, one thread is writing content on a file at the same time another thread is performing spelling check.</br>
                • In Multiprocessing, Each process has its own address in memory. So, each process allocates separate memory area.</br>
                • Switching from one process to another require some time for saving and loading registers, memory maps,updating lists etc. So that cost of communication between the processes is high.</br>
                • Disadvantage: If you create too many threads, you can actually degrade the performance of your program rather than enhance it.</br>
                • Remember, some overhead is associated with context switching. If you create too many threads, more CPU time will be spent changing contexts than executing your program.</br>
            </h5>

            <h3><strong>Life Cycle of Thread</strong> </h3>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">

                • A thread goes through various stages in its life cycle. For example, a thread is born, started, runs,
                and then dies.</br>
                </br>
                • New:</br>
                A new thread begins its life cycle in the New state. It remains in this state until the program
                starts the thread by invoking Start() method.It is also referred to as a born thread.</br>
                </br>
                • Runnable:</br>
                The thread is in runnable state after invocation of start() method,but the thread scheduler has
                not selected it to be the running thread.</br>
                The thread is in running state if the thread scheduler has selected it.</br>
                </br>
                • Waiting:</br>
                Sometimes a thread transitions to the waiting state while the thread waits for another thread
                to perform a task. A thread transitions back to the runnable state only when another thread
                signals the waiting thread to continue executing.</br>
                </br>
                • Timed waiting:</br>
                A runnable thread can enter the timed waiting state for a specified interval of time. A thread
                in this state transition back to the runnable state when that time interval expires or when the
                event It is waiting for occurs.</br>
                </br>
                • Terminated:</br>
                A runnable thread enters the terminated state when it (run() method exits) completes its task.</br>
            </h5>

            <h3><strong>Thread Priorities</strong> </h3>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">

                Every Java thread has a priority that helps the operating system determine the order in which
                threads are scheduled.</br>
                • Java priorities are in the range between MIN_PRIORITY (a constant of 1) and MAX_PRIORITY (a
                constant of 10).</br>
                By default, every thread is given priority NORM_PRIORITY (a constant of 5).</br>
                • Threads with higher priority are more important to a program and should be allocated processor
                time before lower-priority threads.</br>
                • The thread scheduler mainly uses preemptive or time slicing scheduling to schedule the threads.</br>
                </br>
                <strong>Creating a Thread</strong></br>
                • Thread class provide constructors and methods to create and perform operations on a thread.</br>
                </br>
                1) Constructor of Thread class:</br>
                Thread ()</br>
                Thread (String name)</br>
                Thread (Runnable r)</br>
                Thread (Runnable r, String name)</br>
                </br>
                2) Methods of Thread Class:</br>

                public void run() -- Entry point for a thread</br>
                public void start() -- Start a thread by calling run() method.</br>
                public String getName() -- Return thread's name.</br>
                public void setName(String name) -- To give thread a name</br>
                public int getPriority() -- Return thread's priority.</br>
                public int setPriority(int priority) -- Sets the priority of this Thread object. The possible values are between1and 10.</br>
                public final boolean isAlive() -- Checks whether thread is still running or not.</br>
                public static void sleep(long millisec) -- Suspend thread for a specified time.</br>
                public final void join(long millisec) -- Wait for a thread to end.</br>
                </br>
                • Java defines two ways by which a thread can be created.</br>
                </br>
                1) By implementingthe Runnable interface:</br>
                • The easiest way to create a thread is to create a class that implements the runnable
                interface.</br>
                • After implementing runnable interface, the class needs to implement the run(} method,
                which has following form:</br>
                public void run( )</br>
                • This method provides entry point for the thread and you will put you complete business
                logic inside this method.</br>
                • After that, you will instantiate a Thread object using the following constructor:</br></br>
                • Thread (Runnable threadObj,String threadName);</br>
                • Where, threadObj is an instance of a class that implements the Runnable interface and
                threadName is the name given to the new thread.</br>
                • Once Thread object is created, you can start it by calling start( ) method, which executes a
                call to run( ) method.</br>
                void start ( );</br>
                </br>
                2) By extending the Thread class.</br>
                • Second way to create a thread is to create a new class that extends Thread class and then
                create an instance of that class.</br>
                • The extending class must override the run( ) method, which is the entry point for the new
                thread.</br>
                • Once Thread object is created, you can start it by calling startf ) method, which executes a
                call to run( ) method.</br>
            </h5>

            <h3><strong>Thread Synchronization</strong> </h3>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">

                • When two or more threads need access to a shared resource, they need some way to ensure that the resource will be used by only one thread at a time.</br>
                • The process by which this synchronization achieved is called thread synchronization.</br>
                • The synchronized keyword in Java creates a block of code referred to as a critical section.</br>
                • Every Java object with a critical section of code gets a lock associated with the object.</br>
                • To enter a critical section, a thread needs to obtain the corresponding object's lock.</br>
                </br>
                Syntax:</br>
                synchronized(object)</br>
                {</br>
                // statements to be synchronized</br>
                }</br>
                Here, object is a reference to the object being synchronized.</br>
                A synchronized block ensures that a call to a method that is a member of object occurs only after the current thread has successfully entered object's critical section.</br>
            </h5>

            <h3><strong>Inter-thread Communication</strong> </h3>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">

                • Inter-thread communication or Co-operation is all about allowing synchronized threads to
                communicate with each other.</br>
                • Inter-thread communication is a mechanism in which a thread is paused running in its critical
                section and another thread is allowed to enter (or lock) in the same critical section to be executed.</br>
                • To avoid polling(It is usually implemented by loop), Inter-thread communication is implemented
                by following methods of Object class:</br>
                • wait( ): This method tells the calling thread to give up the critical section and go to sleep until
                some other thread enters the same critical section and calls notify( ).</br>
                • notify( ): This method wakes up the first thread that called wait( ) on the same object.</br>
                • notifyAll( ): This method wakes up all the threads that called wait( ) on the same object. The highest priority thread will run first.</br>
                • Above all methods are implemented as final in Object class.</br>
                • All three methods can be called only from within a synchronized context.</br>
